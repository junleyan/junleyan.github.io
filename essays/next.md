The 2022 SlashData survey found that there are over 17 million JavaScript developers worldwide, making it the leading language among popular ones like Python and Java.

Part of the reason why for its popularity is largely contributed by the introduction of JavaScript framework like React, which simplified the development of applications. Additionally, developers can use package managers like npm (Node.js package manager) to install JavaScript libraries, extending JavaScript's capabilities, and reducing the amount of code you have to write yourself. As time went on, new framework was developed on top of React to improve upon it. Leading to the birth of many other hyped up frameworks every years.

Among them, the framework that has gained the most popularity in recent years is Next.js, which aims to simplify the development of React applications with server-side rendering. Since Next.js is based on React, they share similar features. However, Next.js goes a step further by including additional functionalities such as routing, code splitting, and pre-rendering. These tools are built into Next.js, meaning developers don't have to configure anything manually thanks to these features.

In the future, I intend to transition some of my personal projects to Next.js to improve SEO and leverage its built-in functionalities. By learning features like server-side rendering and code splitting, I aim to create more advanced and compelling projects. This will not only expand my skill set as a developer but also deepen my understanding of the complex intricacies of web development.
