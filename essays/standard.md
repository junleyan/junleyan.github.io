# My Reflections on Coding Standards

When I first started programming, coding standards seemed like trivial preferencesâ€”whether to use tabs or spaces, where to place braces, or how to name variables. I thought these were minor details that didn't significantly impact the quality of the code. However, over time, I've come to realize that coding standards are far more crucial than mere stylistic choices. In fact, I agree that if there's one software engineering technique that can substantially improve code quality, it's the consistent application of robust coding standards.

Coding standards do more than make code look neat; they enhance readability, maintainability, and reduce the likelihood of errors. By adhering to a consistent set of guidelines, teams can collaborate more effectively, as everyone writes code in a uniform manner. This consistency makes it easier to read and understand each other's code, facilitating quicker reviews and smoother onboarding of new team members.

Interestingly, I've found that coding standards can also accelerate the learning process when picking up a new programming language. By following established best practices, you not only write better code but also deepen your understanding of the language's nuances. The standards often encapsulate lessons learned from common pitfalls and advanced features, providing a roadmap for writing efficient and effective code.

# My Experience with ESLint and VSCode

After my first week of using ESLint with VSCode, I have mixed feelings both appreciative and, at times, a bit frustrated. ESLint has been incredibly useful in catching errors and enforcing coding standards in real-time. It points out syntactical mistakes, potential bugs, and deviations from agreed-upon style guidelines, which has undoubtedly improved the quality of my code.

However, addressing every ESLint warning can be tedious, especially when the tool flags minor issues that don't seem to impact functionality. At times, it feels like I'm spending more time satisfying the linter than writing actual code. But I've come to realize that these "minor" issues can accumulate, leading to technical debt and harder to maintain codebases in the long run.

The initial pain of fixing these errors is outweighed by the benefits. ESLint has made me more disciplined and attentive to details I might have overlooked otherwise. It's like having an ever-vigilant code reviewer that's always available, helping me adhere to best practices and improve my coding habits.

# Conclusion

Coding standards are not just about aesthetics; they're a foundational aspect of professional software development. They enhance collaboration, reduce errors, and even aid in learning new languages more effectively. Tools like ESLint might seem demanding at first, but they serve an essential role in maintaining code quality and consistency. Embracing coding standards and the tools that enforce them is a worthwhile investment that pays off in the form of cleaner, more maintainable, and reliable code.
