# My Reflections on Coding Standards

When I first started programming, coding standards seemed like trivial preferencesâ€”whether to use tabs or spaces, where to place braces, or how to name variables. I thought these were minor details that didn't significantly impact the quality of the code. However, over time, I've come to realize that coding standards are far more important than just stylistic choices. In fact, I agree that if there's one software engineering technique that can significantly improve code quality, it is the consistent use of coding standards.

Coding standards do more than make code look neat. They enhance readability, maintainability, and reduce the likelihood of errors. By obeying by a set of guidelines, teams can collaborate more effectively, as everyone writes code in a uniform manner. This makes it easier to read and understand each other's code, which allows for quicker reviews and smoother onboarding of new team members.

# My Experience with ESLint and VSCode

After my first week of using ESLint with VSCode, I have mixed feelings both appreciative and, at times, a bit frustrated. ESLint is incredibly useful in catching errors and enforcing coding standards in real-time. It points out syntactical mistakes and potential bugs, which has undoubtedly improved the quality of my code.

However, addressing every ESLint warning can be tedious at times, especially when the tool flags minor issues that don't seem to impact functionality. At times, it feels like I'm spending more time satisfying the linter than writing actual code. But I've come to realize that these "minor" issues can accumulate, leading to technical debt and harder to maintain codebases in the long run.

In my opinion, the initial pain of fixing these errors is outweighed by the benefits. ESLint has made me more disciplined at code writing. It's like having an code reviewer that's always available. 

# Conclusion

Coding standards are not just about aesthetics; they're a foundational aspect of professional software development. They improve collaboration and reduce errors. Tools like ESLint might seem demanding at first, but they serve an essential role in maintaining code quality and consistency. Embracing coding standards and the tools that enforce them is a worthwhile investment that pays off in the form of cleaner, more maintainable, and reliable code.
