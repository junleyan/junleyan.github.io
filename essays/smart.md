## Why Smart Questions Are Crucial for Software Engineers
Communication is essential for software engineers, especially when working in a collaborative environment. In Eric Raymond's "How to Ask Questions the Smart Way," he provides guidelines on how to ask questions effectively. When smart quesition are asked, it maximizes the efficiency of problem-solving, and leads to high quality answers. On the other hand, poorly ask questions waste time and resources. In this essay, I will examine two examples from StackOverflow—a smart one that follows Raymond's advice and one that does not—to demonstrate the difference between smart and poorly asked questions.

## The Good
<i>["How do I merge two dictionaries in a single expression in Python?"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38987/how-do-i-merge-two-dictionaries-in-a-single-expression-in-python)</i> This question provides an excellent example that follow the precepts established by Raymond of how to ask a smart question 

The title, <i>"How do I merge two dictionaries in a single expression in Python?"</i>, is both clear and descriptive. It provides precise context by specifying the goal of merging two Python dictionaries, avoiding confusion with similar data structures like hash map from other languages. The user also includes a specific example of the desired outcome, showing two dictionaries, `x` and `y`, and the expected output for the merged dictionary, `z`.
```python
x = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
y = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
z = merge(x, y)

>>> z
{'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
```
The question clearly states that the user wants to achieve the result in a single expression and defines the behavior they expect when encountering conflicting keys, eliminating any ambiguity in the question.

## The Bad
<i>["What is setup.py?"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1471994/what-is-setup-py)</i> The title and body of the question are brief and vague. Furthermore, they lack the context and specificity essential for effective communication in technical forums. The user does not provide any code or examples related to `setup.py`, which would help clarify their question and provide necessary context. Without this information, readers will struggle to understand what the author is referring to when discussing `setup.py`. Moreover, the author does not describe any particular issues they are facing or specific scenarios where they are having trouble using `setup.py`. As a result, the question feels overly general.
