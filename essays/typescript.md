## What I Think So Far

So far, I am loving Typescripts. Because TypeScript is a strongly-typed language with type restrictions unlike Javascript, I find development to be more smoother as I dont have to back and fore to check what the functions returns since I can just read it from the IDE suggestion popup, making collaberation much more efficient.
