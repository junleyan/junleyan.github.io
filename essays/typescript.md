## What I Think So Far

So far, Iâ€™m loving TypeScript. As a strongly-typed language, TypeScript offers clear type restrictions that make development smoother. Unlike JavaScript, where you often need to check function returns manually, TypeScript's IDE suggestions provide immediate feedback. From a software engineering perspective, TypeScript enhances collaboration by eliminating the need to guess return types or sift through comments. The return type is explicitly stated in the function header, allowing developers to quickly understand what a function returns and reducing the risk of bugs caused by incorrect types.
