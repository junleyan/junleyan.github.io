## What I Think So Far
So far, I’m loving TypeScript. As a strongly-typed language, TypeScript offers clear type restrictions that make development smoother. Unlike JavaScript, where you often need to check function returns manually, TypeScript's IDE suggestions provide immediate feedback. From a software engineering perspective, TypeScript enhances collaboration by eliminating the need to guess return types or sift through comments. The return type is explicitly stated in the function header, allowing developers to quickly understand what a function returns and reducing the risk of bugs caused by incorrect types. However, I find it frustrating that I have to write so much boilerplate code, which I could have avoided if I were using JavaScript.

## My Thoughts on WOD
So far, I haven’t found the WOD (Workouts of the Day) particularly helpful for improving my problem-solving skills or proficiency in TypeScript. However, I believe that as our class progresses and the WODs become more challenging, they will become quite beneficial. They provide hands-on experience and reinforce our learning. Additionally, WODs simulate scenarios commonly encountered in technical interviews, helping us adapt to these situations and better prepare for them.
