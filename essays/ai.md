# I. Introduction
AI has been a game-changer in tech, education, and especially for computer science students like me. It's like having an unpaid intern who's always there to help with tedious tasks you aren't willing to do. So far, I've only tried AI models from OpenAI, like GPT-4o and GPT-o1, but they have been a huge boost to my productivity. Mainly, I use AI to bring my ideas to life, which gives me more time to focus on problem-solving.

# II. Personal Experience with AI

## 1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
In Experience WOD E18, I chose not to use AI because the task was straightforward and only required a basic implementation of a forEach loop and conditional statements. Using AI would have likely taken me longer, as I would need to spend additional time writing prompts and providing the necessary context.

## 2. In-Class Practice WODs
For the in-class practice WODs, I chose not to use AI because I viewed them as an opportunity to better understand development concepts. Additionally, since the WODs were not graded and had no time constraints, there was no pressure to complete them quickly.

## 3. In-Class WODs
For in-class WODs, I chose not to use AI for the same reason I avoided it during practice WODs. I viewed them as an opportunity to better understand development concepts. Additionally, time constraints were never an issue for me, as I consistently finished well within the allotted time, and often using less than half of it.

## 4. Essays
For essays, I begin by jotting down all my thoughts, even if the grammar is incorrect or the sentence structure is messy. Once everything is written, I use ChatGPT to correct grammar and refine the sentence structure, in order to ensure the final version sounds more formal and polished.

## 5. Final Project
For my final project, I used ChatGPT to handle tedious tasks, such as generating HTML code for the desired layout. This eliminated the need to write boilerplate code and allowed me to focus on the project's logical components. By reducing the time spent on creating the layout from scratch, I was able to dedicate more time to other tasks which significantly speed up the development process.

## 6. Learning a Concept / Tutorial
When learning a new concept or following a tutorial, I prefer referring to official documentation rather than relying on AI tools like ChatGPT. I find that AI often provides inaccurate or outdated information, which can sometimes be unhelpful. Additionally, official documentation tends to be more concise and easier to read compared to the lengthy and sometimes redundant explanations generated by ChatGPT.

## 7. Answering a Question in Class or in Discord
When answering questions in class, I avoid using AI because it doesnâ€™t help me truly learn or engage with the material. The purpose of the professor's questions is to assess our understanding, not our ability to consult a chatbot and recite its answers.

## 8. Asking or Answering a Smart-Question
When writing questions or answers, I often use ChatGPT to check for grammar errors and improve sentence structure to ensures my message is clear so it is easy for others to understand.
