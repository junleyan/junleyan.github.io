# How I Came to Appreciate Design Patterns
When I first started writing code, my approach was pretty naive. I’d open Visual Studio Code, write a bit of logic, and watch it run. If my program produced the right result, I’d consider it a win and move on. I wasn’t overly concerned with structure or long-term maintainability. I just wanted to solve the immediate problem, and it felt liberating. No complex guidelines, no heavy frameworks, just me, the code, and a quick sense of accomplishment. But as my projects grew, so did the complexity. Suddenly, making a small change in one corner of the codebase would create a domino effect of strange bugs somewhere else. I found myself wrestling with a tangle of functions and variables, and the carefree coding style I loved began to feel like a liability.
